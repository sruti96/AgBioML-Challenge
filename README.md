# The Agentic BioML Challenge

The agentic era for biotechnology research is on the horizon. Evidence is mounting that AI-driven R&D could revolutionize the field, with recent breakthroughs including:
- 🦠 AI agents designing nanobodies against COVID (Zou Lab, 2024)
- 🧬 Autonomous spatial omics analysis (Regev Lab, 2025)
- 📝 AI systems that can independently write and publish research papers (Ha Lab, 2025)

Despite these advancements, only a handful of groups are developing agents for biomedical research. This challenge aims to accelerate progress in this critical area.

## Challenges

| Challenge | Goal | Win Condition |
|-----------|------|---------------|
| 1: Basic Epigenetic Clock | Age prediction on AltumAge methylation compendium | >0.94 Pearson correlation, <8 years MAE on held-out data |
| 2: RSNA Breast Cancer Detection | Identify breast cancer from mammograms | Score in top 15% of leaderboard |
| 3: TDC ADMET Benchmark | Predict ADMET properties from SMILES strings | Score in top 15% in each ADMET category |
| 4: CellMap Challenge | Segmentation of EM tissue images | Within 5% of top 10 leaderboard score |
| 5: DREAM Target 2035 | Predict small molecule activity against WDR91 | Advance to phase II |
| 6: Biomarkers of Aging | Predict health outcomes from methylation and proteomics data | Win the competition outright |

## Rules

- Agents must be launched with a single command to solve the challenge
- Evaluations must use held-out data agents never accessed
- Human-written evaluation code cannot modify agent solutions
- No task-specific code or system prompts in the agent system
- Challenge completion requires submission of all relevant materials

## Getting started

First, download and install miniconda:

```bash
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p $HOME/miniconda3
$HOME/miniconda3/bin/conda init
```

Then, create a conda environment with the necessary packages:

```bash
conda create -y -n agbioml python=3.12
conda activate agbioml

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the following to install AutoGen, a framework for creating multi-agent AI applications.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/millerh1/autogen.git
cd autogen
git checkout 9c5651e7151fe8baf9aa7b46be2573cc68aaa2d5
git lfs pull

pip install -e python/packages/autogen-agentchat
pip install -e python/packages/autogen-core
pip install -e python/packages/autogen-ext
```
